#This Chrome extension is designed to help users understand and improve their online habits by tracking the time they spend on various websites and categorizing their usage into productive and unproductive activities. By running in the background while the browser is active, the extension logs how long a user spends on each domain and stores this data locally using Chrome’s storage API. It captures when users switch tabs and calculates the active time spent on each website. Through a simple popup interface, users can view a breakdown of their daily activity in minutes, along with totals for time spent on productive sites like coding platforms and unproductive ones like social media. This gives users immediate insights into how their online time is distributed.

In addition to the local tracking, the extension can be paired with a backend server (built using Node.js, Flask, or Django) that collects usage data for long-term analytics. This backend stores time logs in a database such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL, allowing users to view weekly or monthly productivity trends. The server can generate reports that highlight the most visited sites, compare productive vs. unproductive time, and visualize behavioral patterns through charts. With this two-part system—client-side tracking and server-side reporting—the tool provides both real-time feedback and in-depth productivity analytics. It's ideal for users aiming to reduce distractions, enhance focus, or monitor digital well-being over time.#
